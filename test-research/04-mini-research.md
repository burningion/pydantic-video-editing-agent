# Early Roots of Tree Protection: Common Law and Conservation

At common law, trees on private land were simply part of the realty, and cutting them constituted trespass (and possibly conversion) rather than a distinct crime.  Damages for cutting another’s trees depended on the trespasser’s intent: an “innocent” cutter owed the stumpage value of the timber, while a willful trespasser typically owed the higher gross sale value upon delivery ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1431794.html#:~:text=At%20common%20law%2C%20cutting%20someone,that%20the%20person%20was%20a)).  Courts soon recognized this was often a hard choice – in *Bolles v. United States* (1882), for example, felled timber valued only $60 at the stump was worth $850 in town, and the Supreme Court upheld using the $850 figure precisely to deter further theft ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=under%201,DIEHR%20%28DO%20NOT)).  Despite this, by the late 19th century lawmakers and jurists saw common law remedies as inadequate, especially when trees had “intangible” qualities (scenic or ecological value) that market prices did not capture ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=suggested%20that%20separate%20statutory%20timber,LARSSON)).

Concurrently, an early conservation ethos arose.  In the 1880s–1890s, Northeastern states moved to preserve forest reserves and protect public trees.  For instance, New York’s Forest Commission began buying Adirondack lands to protect watersheds, and the 1894 State Constitution enshrined the Adirondack Park as “forever reserved…as forest lands necessary to the preservation of the headwaters of chief rivers… and a future timber supply” ([www.adirondackcouncil.org](https://www.adirondackcouncil.org/page/blog-139/news/one-hundred-and-thirty-years-later-1619.html#:~:text=There%20shall%20be%20a%20park,state%2C%20and%20a%C2%A0future%20timber%20supply)).  Municipalities also began passing tree ordinances.  By the 1890s cities like Washington, D.C. and Boston had laws forbidding girdling or destroying street and shade trees.  New England states appointed “tree wardens” to enforce such rules, reflecting growing value placed on trees beyond timber – for shade and beauty.  These early measures were largely ad hoc or local, but they signaled a shift: trees would be treated not just as fungible goods but as natural resources worth special protection. 

# Federal Forest Laws and Early Trespass Penalties

At the turn of the 20th century the federal government also began safeguarding trees and timber.  In 1897 Congress passed the Forest Organic Act, empowering the Department of the Interior to manage national forests “primarily for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber” ([www.adirondackcouncil.org](https://www.adirondackcouncil.org/page/blog-139/news/one-hundred-and-thirty-years-later-1619.html#:~:text=There%20shall%20be%20a%20park,state%2C%20and%20a%C2%A0future%20timber%20supply)).  The new Forest Service (1905) pursued sustainable practices to prevent wholesale cutting.  Important statutes followed: the Lacey Act of 1900 made it a federal crime to import or sell wood taken in violation of any law, punishing what we would today call illegal logging.  Similarly, 18 U.S.C. §1852 (originally 1909) criminalized cutting or willfully destroying timber on public lands; violators faced fines and up to a year’s imprisonment ([www.law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1852#:~:text=Whoever%20cuts%2C%20or%20wantonly%20destroys,of%20the%20United%20States%3B%20or)).  These laws treated timber theft as a serious offense, but did not provide private remedies. 

Over the next decades Congress and agencies refined forest protection.  The Weeks Act (1911) let the federal government buy private forest lands to protect watersheds, expanding preserved timberlands.  National parks and monuments banned cutting trees outright.  Indian reservations and trust lands also gained attention: the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act and later the 1990 Indian Forest Resources Management Act gave tribal owners a larger role in forest management.  By the late 20th century detailed regulations (e.g. 25 C.F.R. §163.29) held trespassers liable for **treble damages** for ANY removal of tribal forest products – no proof of intent needed – plus restoration costs ([www.law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/163.29#:~:text=,materials%20involved%20in%20the%20trespass)).  In short, federal law evolved from mere criminal penalties to strong civil deterrents in specialized contexts.

# State Statutory Trespass Laws and Treble Damages

By the mid-20th century, many states had enacted specific “timber trespass” statutes to go beyond common law.  Typically, these statutes made it unlawful to cut trees on another’s land without permission and provided aggressive remedies.  Most notably, they allowed the landowner to recover *treble damages* – often three times the timber’s stumpage value – against an unauthorized cutter.  For example, Connecticut’s law (1961) imposed triple the reasonable value of felled trees (five times for Christmas trees) unless the defendant genuinely believed the trees were on his own land ([cga.ct.gov](https://cga.ct.gov/2023/pub/chap_925.htm#:~:text=Sec.%2052,timber%20or%20shrubbery%2C%20it%20shall)).  Similarly, Kentucky’s 1956 statute (still in force) declared that anyone cutting timber “without color of title” owes three times the timber’s value plus legal costs ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1431794.html#:~:text=this%20chapter%20shall%20be%20considered,as%20additional%20thereto)) ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1431794.html#:~:text=The%20statute%20%28KRS%20364,The%20statute%20now%20reads)).  Louisiana’s “Timber Trespass Act” (first enacted 1974) likewise forbids cutting trees without consent and mandates treble damages plus attorney fees for willful or even negligent cutters ([www.ecologylawquarterly.org](https://www.ecologylawquarterly.org/currents/redressing-the-loss-of-slave-era-trees-evans-v-bedsole-and-what-louisiana-timber-trespass-law-cant-do/#:~:text=effect%20since%201974.,they%20needed%20consent%20from%20the)).  In all these laws, the goal was deterrence: lawmakers observed that simple compensation left little penalty for so-called “timber pirates,” so imposing treble damages was seen as necessary “to impose a penalty upon those who disregard the property rights of timber owners” ([www.ecologylawquarterly.org](https://www.ecologylawquarterly.org/currents/redressing-the-loss-of-slave-era-trees-evans-v-bedsole-and-what-louisiana-timber-trespass-law-cant-do/#:~:text=deterrent%20due%20to%20its%20severe,18)).

These statutes often contain fine print to protect bona fide mistakes.  Most allow only actual (single) damages if the trespasser “in good faith” thought the trees were his, or if he took timber only for public work (e.g. road repair).  But the default is punitive.  By one count, over forty states have timber-trespass statutes, many patterned on Rocky Mountain or New England precedents ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=damages%20may%20be%20recovered,Although%20discussion%20of)).  For example, in Oregon the statute creates treble damages for knowing trespass by a person “willfully, intentionally and without plaintiff’s consent,” while Washington law imposes triple damages *“whether or not defendant’s conduct was knowing or intentional”* ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=102%20ALASKA%20LAW%20REVIEW%20,other%20valuable%20resource%20from%20the)).  Across the country, these laws share a common feature: they treat trees as distinct from ordinary land, deserving extra penalty when stolen.

# Notable Court Decisions

Courts have both shaped and been shaped by these laws.  Early judge-made cases clarified common-law damages: Kentucky’s *Meece v. Feldman* (2009) reviewed the 1956 statute and confirmed the move from “innocent vs. willful” to a color-of-title standard for treble liability ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1431794.html#:~:text=the%20civil%20remedies,is%20a%20given%20and%20we)) ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1431794.html#:~:text=this%20chapter%20shall%20be%20considered,as%20additional%20thereto)).   In *Meece* the Kentucky Supreme Court explained that courts weigh a trespasser’s intent via “color of title” (legal appearance of ownership) to decide if triple damages apply ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-supreme-court/1431794.html#:~:text=Other%20than%20adding%20punitive%20damages%2C,17)). Likewise, the California case *Drewry v. Welch* (1965) upheld double damages (then the state’s rule) even for “casual or involuntary” trespasses, noting the policy choice to slam down a stiff penalty to protect timber ([law.justia.com](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/236/159.html#:~:text=Drewry%20v,has%20been%20passed%20upon)). 

Several recent cases illustrate modern issues.  In *Chacey v. Garvey* (Va. 2015), Virginia’s Supreme Court interpreted a timber-trespass statute to require an owner’s demand before suit; the court ultimately let treble damages (and reforestation costs) stand for intent-to-convert trespass ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/va-supreme-court/1722112.html#:~:text=as%20requested,fencing%2C%20and%20the%20stone%20bridge)) ([caselaw.findlaw.com](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/va-supreme-court/1722112.html#:~:text=At%20trial%2C%20Mr,Garvey%20testified)).  In Louisiana, the *Evans v. Bedsole* litigation (1988) tested the state treble law’s adequacy in a racially charged context, where descendants of slaves lost ancestral pecan trees.  The courts affirmed treble damages for the intentional Bedsole trespass but denied “mental anguish” damages to one plaintiff, underscoring that the timber statute was designed to value trees as commercial property, not sentimental assets ([www.ecologylawquarterly.org](https://www.ecologylawquarterly.org/currents/redressing-the-loss-of-slave-era-trees-evans-v-bedsole-and-what-louisiana-timber-trespass-law-cant-do/#:~:text=referred%20to%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9Ctimber,they%20needed%20consent%20from%20the)) ([www.ecologylawquarterly.org](https://www.ecologylawquarterly.org/currents/redressing-the-loss-of-slave-era-trees-evans-v-bedsole-and-what-louisiana-timber-trespass-law-cant-do/#:~:text=deterrent%20due%20to%20its%20severe,18)). Tribally, decisions have likewise favored strict enforcement: under 25 C.F.R. §163.29, Indian plaintiffs may recover three times the highest stumpage value automatically, requiring no proof of malice ([www.law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/163.29#:~:text=,materials%20involved%20in%20the%20trespass)). 

# Impact on Forestry and Property Rights 

The evolution of tree-protection laws reflects changing values.  By treating timber theft as a serious offense, treble-damage statutes incentivize landowners and loggers to respect boundaries and permits, supporting sustainable forest management.  These laws give private owners (as well as public landholders) a powerful means of enforcing property rights; for example, a Maine landowner can sue a trespasser under the general statute for treble damages ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=damages%20may%20be%20recovered,Although%20discussion%20of)).  In practice, this has deterred many would-be thieves.  As one Louisiana judge noted, severe penalties have turned the tide against “timber pirates” and helped ensure that cutting is done only under lawful agreement ([www.ecologylawquarterly.org](https://www.ecologylawquarterly.org/currents/redressing-the-loss-of-slave-era-trees-evans-v-bedsole-and-what-louisiana-timber-trespass-law-cant-do/#:~:text=noted%20in%201987%20that%20under,18)).

At the same time, these punitive regimes sometimes collide with other policy goals.  Some commentators argue that focusing on market value may undercompensate owners for the aesthetic or ecological loss of old trees ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=suggested%20that%20separate%20statutory%20timber,LARSSON)).  Modern remedies like reforestation awards or restoration of trees (ordered in cases like *Wiersum v. Harder* (Alaska) and *Chung v. Park*) attempt to address this gap.  Overall, however, the “treble damages” approach has become standard: it embodies the idea that forests, once seen as inexhaustible, require strong legal protection, and that violators of this public trust should pay generously to make landowners whole.  In sum, U.S. timber trespass law has evolved from modest common-law damages to robust statutory penalties – mirroring a broader shift in law from viewing trees merely as property to acknowledging their lasting community and environmental value ([docslib.org](https://docslib.org/doc/4854802/cutting-down-damages-awards-in-timber-trespass-cases#:~:text=suggested%20that%20separate%20statutory%20timber,LARSSON)) ([www.ecologylawquarterly.org](https://www.ecologylawquarterly.org/currents/redressing-the-loss-of-slave-era-trees-evans-v-bedsole-and-what-louisiana-timber-trespass-law-cant-do/#:~:text=noted%20in%201987%20that%20under,18)).
