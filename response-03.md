> Nathan Fielder’s journey began in the Canadian comedy scene, where he first honed the techniques that would define his style. After earning a business degree in 2005, Fielder pivoted to comedy and moved to Toronto to study improv and make short films (https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nathan-fielder). Between 2006 and 2011, he created DIY comedy videos and shorts, some of which he uploaded to YouTube, showcasing his talent for uncomfortable humor in embryonic form (https://www.vulture.com/article/nathan-fielder-best-early-comedy-videos.html). His big break came with a segment on the CBC’s satirical news show *This Hour Has 22 Minutes* (2007–2009), where he developed a recurring bit called “Nathan On Your Side” (https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nathan-fielder). In these segments, Fielder played a naïvely earnest consumer watchdog, ambushing real people and officials with bizarre questions in a flat, serious tone. This early work introduced viewers to Fielder’s awkward persona – soft-spoken, painfully sincere, and unflinchingly deadpan – which often made those around him squirm or puzzle over whether he was joking. Many hallmarks of his later comedy were already evident: a zealous commitment to the bit, interactions that teetered between sincere and absurd, and a fascination with how ordinary people respond to uncomfortable situations (https://www.vulture.com/article/nathan-fielder-best-early-comedy-videos.html). These Canadian projects essentially served as a proving ground for Fielder’s signature style, allowing him to refine the art of making audiences (and his unwitting subjects) question what was real and what was satire.
